# The mount service is a multiplexed service. This means you must have
# symbolic links to it in your init.d directory for each file system you
# want to mount. I recommend naming those symbolic links the same as the
# paths to the file systems they mount, removing the leading slash and
# substituting _ for the remaining slashes, for example:
#
# cd /etc/init.d
# ln -s mount mount.usr
# ln -s mount mount.usr_local
#
# Set up a symbolic link like this for each file system you wish to
# mount, then add the symbolic link to the appropriate runlevel. Once
# that is done, add the appropriate definitions for the file system to
# this file.
#
#You will need to define the mountpoint and any dependencies for each
#filesystem as shown here.
#
#If the mountpoint does not match an entry in fstab, the mount will be
#ignored.
#
#mount_usr_mountpoint="/usr"
